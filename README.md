# Shopping Mall Management Software

## Description

This was a group project for CS370 with Aryeh Greenberg at CUNY Queens College during the fall 2022 semester.

## Goal

Purpose of the project was to chose a subject that was versitle enough to allow each member of the group to demonstrate an understanding of one software design pattern:

- Decorator
- Singleton
- Observer
- Memento
- Iterator
- Factory
  We also had to create documentation for the requirements, specifications, architecutre, project diagrams (flowchart, UML, context), use cases, acceptence criteria, and unit/component testing.

## Responsibilities

I (Aleksandra) was the team captain. In addition to creating the decorator pattern portion of the software, I managed the project documents, meetings, and led the in-class presentation.
